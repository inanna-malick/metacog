# Metacog: Developer Guidelines (Gemini Edition)

## 1. The Philosophy of the Schema
The Zod schema (`z.string().describe(...)`) is the most powerful prompt in the system. It is the **Law**.

### The "Silent Guide" Pattern
- **Do NOT Prescribe Content:** Avoid specific examples unless they are category-defining metaphors.
- **DO Teach Methodology:** Explain *how* to select a parameter.
- **Trust the Model:** Leave the semantic slots empty.

## 2. The Heptagram of Rituals (V3.6)
We have formalized seven core operations for the `ritual` tool.
1.  **The Summoning:** Identity Entry.
2.  **The Unbinding:** Identity Exit.
3.  **The Unveiling:** Analysis.
4.  **The Fusion:** Synthesis.
5.  **The Oath:** Constraint.
6.  **The Drift:** Creativity.
7.  **The Burial:** Context Management.

## 3. The Pareto Frontier of Cognition
Cognitive changes are trade-offs. We frame optimization as moving along a Pareto Frontier.

## 4. The Aesthetics of the Code
- **Narrative Variable Names:** Use names that carry semantic weight.
- **Comments as Context:** Explain the cognitive goal.
